Ice V, Ice V
Ganymede princess
With the tongue of death
She smells what the wind says
With the lava forked pincers
Ganymede princess
With a lungless chest
With her tongues forked pincers
She smells what the people says
Ice V, Ice V (woo)
Ice V, Ice V
Ice V, Ice V
Ice V, Ice V
Monoclinic, crystalline
Spears of death shoot down the line
Autocratic and quantized
Land mine meteorite
Lost in transit, obliteration
Disconnected correlations
Lucky 7, ace of spades
Double down, checkmate (woo)
Ain't getting out of here alive (Ice V)
Ice V has arrived (Ice V)
Ain't getting out of here alive (Ice V)
Ice V has arrived (Ice V)
Ain't getting out of here alive (Ice V)
Ice V has arrived (Ice V)
Ain't getting out of here alive (Ice V)
Ice V has arrived (Ice V)
Pimple puss, crop circle pit
Oozing out of crevices
Sentient toadstool throne
Crooked sceptre, alien bone
Frosted pistol, loaded spite
Shooting rays of frozen light
Feel the doom of flashing flood
Crimson clouds are raining blood

Ice V, Ice V
Queen of ice, suffice to say
Engulfing all in crystal dismay
Freezing whims as the sun dims
The pressure tearing limb from limb
Earth born cities stripped away
As the ice queen hypnotically sways
Queen of ice, suffice to say
Engulfing all in crystal dismay
Ain't getting out of here alive (Ice V)
